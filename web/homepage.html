<p>Hi! My name is Michael, and I am excited to be in this class! </p>
<p>I am from a smallish town called Mapleton in Utah, I lived there most of my life. </p>
<p>I now live in Rexburg and attend BYU-Idaho. </p>
<p>I am a software engineering major, and I love it. 
<p>I'll be done with my degree in a couple of semesters. </p>
<p>I am an intern at Navex, a company that has an office here in Rexburg, I love working there. </p>
<p>I have a wife and a six-month-old son who really make my life perfect. </p>
<br/>
<p>I have a lot of interests, and there are a lot of things I love to do. </p>
<p>I love hanging out with my family, playing board and card games, archery, sports, programming, </p>
<p>anything outdoors, art, music (I play a few instruments), reading, writing, learning, etc. </p>
<br/>
<p>I love the Savior, Jesus Christ. I know He lives, I know that the scriptures are really His Word, </p>
<p>and that He reveals His word to prophets today in a restored church. I am so grateful to </p>
<p>be a member of that church and for a Redeemer who has done and continues to do so much for me.</p>
