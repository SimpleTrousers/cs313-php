Hi! My name is Michael, and I am excited to be in this class!
I am from a smallish town called Mapleton in Utah, I lived there most of my life.
I now live in Rexburg and attend BYU-Idaho.
I am a software engineering major, and I love it. I'll be done with my degree in a couple of
semesters.
I am an intern at Navex, a company that has an office here in Rexburg, I love working there.
I have a wife and a six-month-old son who really make my life perfect.

I have a lot of interests, and there are a lot of things I love to do.
I love hanging out with my family, playing board and card games, archery, sports, programming, 
anything outdoors, art, music (I play a few instruments), reading, writing, learning, etc.

I love the Savior, Jesus Christ. I know He lives, I know that the scriptures are really His Word,
and that He reveals His word to prophets today in a restored church. I am so grateful to
be a member of that church and for a Redeemer who has done and continues to do so much for me.
