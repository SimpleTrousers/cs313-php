Hi! My name is Michael, and I am excited to be in this class! <br/>
I am from a smallish town called Mapleton in Utah, I lived there most of my life. <br/>
I now live in Rexburg and attend BYU-Idaho. <br/>
I am a software engineering major, and I love it. 
I'll be done with my degree in a couple of semesters. <br/>
I am an intern at Navex, a company that has an office here in Rexburg, I love working there. <br/>
I have a wife and a six-month-old son who really make my life perfect. <br/>

I have a lot of interests, and there are a lot of things I love to do. <br/>
I love hanging out with my family, playing board and card games, archery, sports, programming, <br/>
anything outdoors, art, music (I play a few instruments), reading, writing, learning, etc. <br/>

I love the Savior, Jesus Christ. I know He lives, I know that the scriptures are really His Word, <br/>
and that He reveals His word to prophets today in a restored church. I am so grateful to <br/>
be a member of that church and for a Redeemer who has done and continues to do so much for me. <br/>
